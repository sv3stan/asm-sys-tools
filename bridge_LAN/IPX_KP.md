This code uses the IPX (Internetwork Packet Exchange) network protocol to transfer files between two computers. It implements the basic functionality of sending and receiving data packets via IPX.

### Program Operation Overview

#### Main Tasks:
1. **Loading the IPX driver** - The program checks if the IPX driver is loaded, which is necessary to work with the IPX protocol.
2. **Opening an IPX socket** - The program opens a socket to transmit data over the network via IPX.
3. **Waiting for a file request** - The program listens for a network request for a specific file.
4. **Reading the file** - Upon receiving a request, the program opens the file, reads it in blocks, and sends it via IPX.
5. **Sending file packets** - After the file is found and read, its contents are sent over the network as data packets.

#### Program Structure:

1. **Messages** - The code defines several messages in Russian that are displayed to the user depending on the situation (successful file transfer, file open error, IPX error, etc.).

2. **Main Variables**:
    - `file_NAME` - A string for storing the name of the file to be transferred.
    - `handle` - A descriptor of the opened file.
    - `buffer_transmit` - A buffer for storing file data to be transmitted.
    - `ipx_socket` - The IPX socket used for data transmission.
    - `ECB` - Elemental Control Block (ECB), a data structure for managing packet transmission via IPX.

3. **Main Process**:
    - **Screen initialization** (using the BIOS interface `INT 10h`) - This sets the video mode and displays program information.
    - **IPX loading** - The program checks for the presence of a loaded IPX driver using `INT 2Fh`, which calls a function to verify if IPX is loaded. If IPX is not installed, an error message is displayed, and the program terminates.
    - **Opening the IPX socket** - The program opens a socket with the number `6666h` for data transmission. This socket is used to send and receive data.
    - **Waiting for a file request** - The program starts listening for a file request using the `ipx_listen` function. When a request is received, the program reads the file name and attempts to open it.
    - **Reading the file** - The file is read in blocks of 512 bytes using the DOS function `INT 21h` (function `3Fh`).
    - **File transmission** - The file content is sent via IPX in blocks of 512 bytes.
    - **Ending the transmission** - After all blocks are transmitted, the program closes the file and socket, then terminates.

### How Does the Code Work?

#### 1. **Loading the IPX Driver**:
   The code checks whether the IPX driver is installed:
   ```asm
   MOV  AX,SEARCH_IPX
   INT  2fh
   CMP  AL,0ffh
   JNE  error
   ```
   If IPX is not found, the program terminates, displaying an error message.

#### 2. **Opening the IPX Socket**:
   The socket is opened via the `IPXOpenSocket` function, and the result is stored in the `ipx_socket` variable. This socket is used for data transmission.

#### 3. **Waiting for a File Request**:
   Using the `ipx_listen` function, the program waits for a packet containing a file request:
   ```asm
   CALL ipx_listen
   ```
   When the request arrives, the program compares the file name with the one specified in the request.

#### 4. **Opening the File**:
   Once the file request is confirmed, the program attempts to open the file for reading:
   ```asm
   MOV  AH,3dh
   MOV  AL,0
   MOV  DX,OFFSET file_NAME
   INT  21h
   ```
   If the file is not found, an error message is displayed.

#### 5. **Reading and Transmitting the File**:
   The program reads the file in 512-byte blocks using the DOS interrupt:
   ```asm
   MOV  AH,3fh
   MOV  BX,handle
   MOV  CX,512
   MOV  DX,OFFSET buffer_transmit
   INT  21h
   MOV LastBlock,AX
   ```
   The read data is then sent through the IPX socket:
   ```asm
   CALL ipx_send
   ```

#### 6. **Ending the Transmission**:
   After completing the transmission, the program closes the file and socket and terminates:
   ```asm
   CALL close_file
   CALL ipx_socket_close
   MOV  AH,4ch
   INT  21h
   ```

### Specifying the File Name

The file name is passed in the `file_NAME` variable. In the current version of the program, the file name is statically set in memory using the command:
```asm
file_NAME DB 13 DUP(0)
```
This 13-byte array can be used to store the file name. Before starting the main data transmission loop, you can fill this array with the name of the file that needs to be transferred.

Thus, if you want to transfer a specific file, you can modify the contents of `file_NAME` at the beginning of the program before starting the data transmission process.

### Summary

The program works by using IPX to transfer files between machines on a network. The main operations include IPX initialization, socket opening, waiting for a file request, reading and sending the file, and closing the socket and file after the process is complete.
