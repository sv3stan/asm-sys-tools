**This code in Assembly for DOS works with the network protocol using NetBIOS and implements timer interrupt (IRQ 0) handling, as well as interaction with network functions through interrupt `5Ch`.**

### Main Blocks:

1. **NCB (Network Control Block)** - a data structure for interacting with network functions such as "Listen", "Add Name", and others, through interrupt `5Ch`. There are two NCBs - `ncb1` and `ncb2`, which are used for different network tasks.

2. **Timer Initialization and Interrupt Handling**:

   - The code handles the timer interrupt (IRQ 0), where the timer counter (`timer`) is decremented each time. When it expires, it checks the status of network operations via the `ncb1_cplt` and `ncb2_cplt` fields. These flags indicate the completion of operations for the respective network control blocks.
   - If the operations are complete, new commands are sent to the network interface using interrupt `5Ch`.

3. **Main Initialization Loop**:

   - Initially, the code loads and initializes the NCB for adding a name (`ncb1_command = 32h`), and upon success, it proceeds to the next step, adding the network name with command `30h`.
   - After successfully adding the name, the code begins network listening (command `91h`) for both NCBs (likely for different sockets or streams).

4. **Error Handling**:

   - For each network operation (e.g., adding a name, listening), in case of an error, messages are displayed on the screen using DOS interrupt `21h` and function `09h` (string output).

5. **Timer Interrupt Interception**:
   - The code intercepts the system timer interrupt (IRQ 0) and replaces it with its own handler `irq_0`. When the timer is called, it checks for the completion of network operations, updates the timer, and sends new commands.

### What the Program Does:

1. Initializes network parameters (device name, buffers, etc.).
2. Sets a timer for polling network commands.
3. Adds a network name and begins listening for network connections (possibly for connections using IPX or NetBIOS protocols).
4. In the main loop, the program waits for incoming network packets and, upon receipt, initiates the appropriate processing.
5. Intercepts the timer interrupt and uses it for regular checks of network status.
