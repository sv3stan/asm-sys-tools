Here’s the English translation of your description of the assembly program designed for MS-DOS that sets a timer and can work with command-line parameters to set the time:

---

The code is written in assembly language and is intended to run in the MS-DOS environment. It implements a program that sets a timer and can also work with command-line parameters for setting the time. Here’s an overview of the main parts of the code and its functionality:

### General Structure of the Program

1. **Segments**:
   - The program operates in the `cseg` segment, which defines the code and data segment.
   - At the beginning of the program, there is a jump to the `init` label.

2. **Variable Declarations**:
   - `times`: an array used to store time (hours, minutes, seconds).
   - `msg` and `msg_err`: strings used to output messages to the user.
   - `old_1ch` and `old_4ah`: variables for storing the addresses of the old interrupt handlers for the timer.

### Main Procedures

1. **`init`**:
   - This procedure is executed at the program's startup and checks the command-line parameters.
   - If the first parameter is 'a', the program will set a timer (with parameters /a:hh:mm); if 'n', the timer will not be set.
   - If there are no parameters or incorrect parameters, an error message is displayed.

2. **`new_1ch` and `new_4ah`**:
   - These procedures are interrupt handlers for the timer. They set new timers.
   - `new_1ch` sets the timer and displays the current time on the screen.
   - `new_4ah` is responsible for generating a sound signal through the speaker.

### Time Handling

- The code reads the current system time using DOS interrupts and converts it into a format suitable for display.
- The time is stored in the `times` array as strings, where each part (hours, minutes, seconds) is represented by a separate byte.
- The time is output to the screen using interrupt `int 10h`, which is responsible for video operations.

### Timer Setting

- The program allows setting a timer with parameters `hh:mm`, which are entered at startup.
- When the set time is reached, a sound signal is triggered, generated using port `61H` and timer `8253`.

### Program Termination

- If the program runs without errors, it terminates by calling interrupt `int 21h`, which returns control to the operating system.

### Usage Examples

- Running with parameters:
  - `prog.exe /a:12:30` - set the timer for 12 hours and 30 minutes.
  - `prog.exe /n` - run without setting a timer.

### Conclusion

The program provides functionality for setting a timer with the ability to process command-line parameters and display the time on the screen. It also replaces the timer interrupt handlers to implement additional functionality, such as a sound signal.
