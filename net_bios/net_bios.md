**This code is written in assembly for the x86 architecture and operates in DOS mode. It implements functionality with NetBIOS, a network communication protocol used in older network systems for data exchange between computers. The main parts of the program are:**

1. **Data Segments:**

   - `ncb` - Network Control Block used for transmitting NetBIOS commands.
   - `group_NAME` - A string containing the group name (in this case, "Sergey Tristan").
   - `buffer_transmit` - A buffer for transmitting data used for sending messages.
   - `length` - The length of the message to be transmitted.

2. **Code Segment:**

   - The program starts by setting the video mode (via interrupt `INT 10h`).
   - It then calls the `load_netbios` procedure, which checks if NetBIOS is installed on the computer. If NetBIOS is not installed, an error message is displayed.

3. **Reading from the Keyboard and Sending a Message:**

   - The program reads characters from the keyboard until the character `'` is entered. The entered characters are saved in the transmission buffer (`buffer_transmit`), after which the length of the message is set.

4. **Working with NetBIOS:**

   - The program adds a group name to NetBIOS using the `nb_addgroupname` procedure.
   - Then, data from the buffer is transmitted over the network using the `nb_senddatagram` procedure.
   - After sending the message, the group name is removed using `nb_deletename`.

5. **Procedures:**
   - `load_netbios` - Checks for the presence of NetBIOS in the system.
   - `nb_addgroupname` - Adds a group name to NetBIOS.
   - `nb_senddatagram` - Sends a message via NetBIOS.
   - `nb_deletename` - Removes a name from NetBIOS.
   - `bin_hex_ascii` - Converts binary data to ASCII characters in hexadecimal format for error display.
   - `error_code` - Displays error codes if issues arise while working with NetBIOS.

**The program operates as follows:**

1. Checks for the NetBIOS protocol.
2. Reads text from the keyboard.
3. Adds the group name to NetBIOS.
4. Transmits the message over the network.
5. Removes the group name from NetBIOS.
6. Terminates the program.

This code is useful for sending messages over NetBIOS in older network systems, such as DOS-based systems.

In the context of working with NetBIOS, "adding a group name" and "removing a group name" are related to the process of managing network names used for interaction between devices on the network. Let's break this down further:

### What is a Name in NetBIOS?

NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) uses so-called "network names" to identify devices (or nodes) in a network. A name can belong to either an individual computer or a group of computers, allowing for data exchange through NetBIOS network functions.

- **Individual Name** - A unique name that is tied to a specific computer or application.
- **Group Name** - A name tied to a group of computers. Any device registered with this name can receive messages sent to that group name.

### Adding a Group Name to NetBIOS

When the program **adds a group name**, it registers this name in the NetBIOS system. This allows other devices on the network to recognize the group and send messages or requests to this name.

- **Group Name** - A common name for several nodes (computers) in the network, grouped by some criterion. Any node registered with such a name can receive messages addressed to that name. For example, if several computers register with the group name "NETGROUP", any message sent to that name will be delivered to all group members.

In the code, the registration of the group name occurs through the `NB_addgroupname` procedure, which writes the name from the `group_NAME` variable into the NetBIOS Control Block (NCB). This process allows the program to join a group of network nodes using the specified name.

### Removing a Group Name from NetBIOS

When the program **removes a group name**, it unregisters that name, meaning it is removed from the list of active network names. This indicates that the device or application is no longer a member of the group and cannot receive messages addressed to that name.

In the code, the removal of the group name is performed through the `nb_deletename` procedure, which deletes the previously registered group name from NetBIOS. This is necessary for properly concluding the use of network names and freeing up resources.

### Example Scenario

1. **Adding a Group Name:** The program registers the name "Sergey Tristan" in NetBIOS. This means that other devices can send messages to this name, and any device registered with this name will be able to receive such messages.
2. **Sending a Message:** The program sends a message over the network to this group name, and all devices registered with this name receive the message.
3. **Removing a Group Name:** After completing the data exchange, the program removes the name "Sergey Tristan" from NetBIOS, so it will no longer receive messages addressed to this group.

Thus, adding and removing a group name in NetBIOS allows for managing network interactions via the NetBIOS protocol, joining or leaving a group.
